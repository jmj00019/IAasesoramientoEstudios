Radiocommunications and radiodetermination is one of the
subjects belonging to the module of telecommunication technologies
in the field of Signal Theory and Communications. This course
enables students to acquire advanced knowledge of antennas,
propagation, and radar and satellite communications.
 


THEORY AND PROBLEMS

1. Rewiew of  Mawell equations in RPS. Sources of the
electromagnetic field. Potential vectors.
2. Antennas: Parameters of the antennas. Types of antennas:
Linear antennas, aperture antennas, reflectors, arrays of antennas.
Array pattern synthesis.
3. Propagation: Link budget, path loss, interferences and
fading. Noise in comunication systems.
4. Satellite comunications: Satellite orbits. Satellite path
free space loss. Rain fading considering ITU Rain Attenuation model
for satellite path.
5. Navigation systems:GPS: Description  of GPS systems.
Common uses of
GPS.         
6. Radar Systems: The radar  range equation. Resolution and
accuracy. False Alarm Rate and probability of
detection           
 

PRACTICE
