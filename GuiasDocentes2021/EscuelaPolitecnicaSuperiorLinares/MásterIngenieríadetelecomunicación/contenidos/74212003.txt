Optical
  Technologies is focused on the study of light
  technologies from the electromagnetic and
  photonic perspective. Communications through optical fibers
  is considered as the main application area and it offers an
  advanced knowledge of optical networks. The key descriptors
  can be summarized as follows:



Introduction
    to Photonics.


Electromagnetics
    fundamentals of optical systems.


Optical
    fibers.


Optical
    Networks.
